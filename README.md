# astroalmanac
astroalmanac produces a graphical astronomical almanac/ephemeris for one
calendar year for a given location.
The almanac includes times of: sun rise, set, and twilight;
moon rise and set with phase; visible planet rise, set, and transit;
and transit for certain bright stars.

The overall layout looks much like the very useful Stargazer's Almanac produced
annually by Sky & Telescope, however, astroalmanac is more low budget.
The background is white--nice for printing.
The text labels are placed by machine rather than by intelligent human, so they
are not always legibly placed, but it works for arbitrary years.
